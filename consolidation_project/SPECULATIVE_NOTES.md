# Speculative Notes (Out-of-Core)

This file collects hypotheses and WIP ideas excluded from the CORE track:

- ψ–consciousness linkage; psychons as excitations in the ψ-sector.
- Prime/p‑adic discretizations for \(\alpha\) and lepton masses.
- CTC and rotating spacetimes beyond standard energy conditions.
- New fields/particles motivated by topological arguments (hopfions, etc.).

**Policy:** These ideas may motivate experiments, but they are not to be cited as established results in the CORE text.
