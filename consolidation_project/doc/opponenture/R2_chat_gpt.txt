On your specific points:

Origin of the Torus
You are right that the compactification mechanism must be shown dynamically. In UBT this is addressed via the Hosotani/Casimir mechanism: the effective one-loop potential on 
𝑇

(
𝜏

(τ) fixes the modulus

τ dynamically, giving a vacuum minimum. The stationary condition is written in Appendix V (Emergent α). This explains both why a torus arises and why τ is unique. (In CORE this is not assumed – the CORE theory works without compactification.)

Scale Issue (m_Z vs. mₑ)
In CORE, α is simply an input. In the extended version, α is fixed at a natural high-energy matching scale

, consistent with QED/QCD renormalization, while lepton masses are related to low-scale excitations. This is not contradictory but a matter of matching across scales, which I will make more explicit in the "Map of limits & matching."

Magic Numbers (207, 3477)
Correct: currently only conjectural. They are expected to arise from the eigenmodes of the Dirac operator on

) with Hosotani holonomy. This remains WIP and is not claimed as CORE. I will clearly label it as such.

KK Tower
The compactification does not necessarily imply a light KK tower. In the full Θ-background the modes can be warped or coupled very weakly to SM states, avoiding LHC bounds. A phenomenological subsection will be added to clarify this scenario.

Conclusion
UBT is a single framework. The OSF article is a CORE summary, not a different formalism. The main article contains the same basis, extended with speculative layers. To make this transparent, I will add to the introduction a "Map of limits & matching" explicitly showing how CORE arises as a limit of the extended theory.

Thank you again for your thoughtful critique – it helps me refine both the presentation and the separation of claims.

Best regards,
David
