\section{Speculative Notes (Out-of-CORE)}
The items below are research hypotheses and work-in-progress ideas. They are \textbf{not} part of the CORE claims and should not be cited as established results.

\subsection{Phase Coordinate $\psi$ and Consciousness}
Interpreting the auxiliary phase coordinate $\psi$ as an information/consciousness phase is a \emph{hypothesis}. It suggests a mapping between phase dynamics and cognitive/entropic processes. Empirical bridges and falsifiable protocols remain future work.

\subsection{Discrete/Prime/\emph{p}-Adic Models}
Prime-based or \emph{p}-adic discretisations for $\alpha$ and lepton masses are exploratory. They are included to document possible mechanisms but are not presented as parameter-free derivations.

\subsection{CTCs, Rotating Spacetimes, and New Particles}
Constructions that rely on exotic energy conditions, closed timelike curves, or new fields/particles (e.g., hopfions, psychons) are tracked here for completeness and future testing proposals.
