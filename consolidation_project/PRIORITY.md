# Priority Claim

This repository documents the origin of the theoretical framework known as the **Unified Biquaternion Theory**, initiated and developed by **Ing. David Jaroš**.

The theory was first published publicly on GitHub on **23.6.2025**, including core definitions, tensor-spinor field structures, covariant equations, and the formulation of complex time as a model of consciousness.

The full structure and mathematical derivations were completed and made public incrementally, with all commits time-stamped and verifiable through the Git version history.

This constitutes a clear and transparent **priority claim** for the origin of the theory.

This claim is made openly and verifiably for any future academic or legal purposes.
