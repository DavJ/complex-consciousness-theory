\section{Policy on the Fine-Structure Constant}
In the CORE manuscript we do not claim an ab-initio derivation of $\alpha$. We adopt $\alpha(\mu)$ with standard QED running and treat $\alpha(\mu_0)$ as an empirical input. Discrete prime/\emph{p}-adic or entropic models are exploratory and documented separately in the Speculative Notes.
