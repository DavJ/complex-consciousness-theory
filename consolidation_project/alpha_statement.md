# Alpha (Fine-Structure Constant) Statement

- In the CORE manuscript we **do not** claim an ab‑initio derivation of \(\alpha\).
- We adopt \(\alpha(\mu)\) with standard QED running and treat \(\alpha(\mu_0)\) as an **empirical input**.
- Discrete prime/p‑adic or entropic models are exploratory and moved to `SPECULATIVE_NOTES.md`.
- Any numerical coincidences with 137 are **not** to be presented as predictions unless derived from a falsifiable, parameter‑free action with clearly stated assumptions and error bars.
