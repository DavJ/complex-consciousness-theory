\begin{abstract}
This article elaborates on the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) introduced in the companion paper, aiming to provide a rigorous mathematical foundation and derive physical predictions from first principles. We construct the theory on a five-complex-dimensional space \( \mathbb{C}^5 \), where the field \( \Theta(q) \in \mathbb{C}^{4 \times 4} \) transforms as a spinor-valued matrix field under both spacetime and internal gauge symmetries. We derive the metric tensor from bilinear invariants, construct the covariant derivative with full Standard Model gauge embedding, quantize the field canonically, and show how classical limits reduce to known physical laws. We discuss how matter properties, including particle masses and gauge couplings, could emerge naturally from the dynamics of the \( \Theta \)-field.
\end{abstract}

\section{Geometric Structure and Field Definitions}
We consider a fundamental spinor-valued matrix field \( \Theta(q) \in \mathbb{C}^{4 \times 4} \) defined over a complexified configuration space \( q \in \mathbb{C}^5 \), where coordinates are labeled \( q^A = (q^\mu, \psi) \), with \( \mu=0,1,2,3 \), and \( \psi \) a complex phase variable associated with conscious drift.

Rather than projecting back to spacetime via \( \pi(q) \), we define observables via bilinear expressions:
\[ O^\mu(q) = \bar{\Theta}(q) \Gamma^\mu \Theta(q), \quad S(q) = \bar{\Theta}(q) \Theta(q). \]
The physical spacetime metric emerges from:
\[ g_{\mu\nu}(q) = \Re\left[ \bar{\Theta} \Gamma_{(\mu} \mathcal{D}_{\nu)} \Theta \right], \]
where \( \mathcal{D}_\mu \) is the full covariant derivative on \( \mathbb{C}^5 \).

\section{Covariant Derivative and Internal Gauge Symmetries}
We construct the covariant derivative as:
\[
\mathcal{D}_A \Theta = \partial_A \Theta + \Omega_A \cdot \Theta + i g_1 B_A Y \Theta + i g_2 W_A^i \tau^i \Theta + i g_3 G_A^a \lambda^a \Theta,
\]
where \( \Omega_A \) is the spin connection and the gauge fields correspond to the Standard Model gauge group \( U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) \).

This structure ensures that \( \Theta(q) \) couples minimally to all gauge bosons and gravity via the unified geometric framework.

\section{Lagrangian and Field Equations}
The full Lagrangian reads:
\[
\mathcal{L} = \Re \left[ \bar{\Theta} i \Gamma^A \mathcal{D}_A \Theta \right] - V(\bar{\Theta}, \Theta) - \frac{1}{4} \sum_a F^a_{AB} F^{aAB},
\]
where \( V \) is a scalar potential breaking degeneracy among internal states and driving phase transitions.

The equations of motion derived from \( \delta S = 0 \) give:
\[
\Gamma^A \mathcal{D}_A \Theta + \frac{\partial V}{\partial \bar{\Theta}} = 0.
\]

\section{Quantization and Spinor Interpretation}
We quantize \( \Theta_{\alpha\beta}(q) \) canonically with anti-commutation relations:
\[ \{ \Theta_{\alpha\beta}(q), \bar{\Theta}_{\gamma\delta}(q') \} = \delta^5(q-q') \delta_{\alpha\gamma} \delta_{\beta\delta}. \]
This structure admits a preonic interpretation, where bound states of \( \Theta \) give rise to fermions with correct quantum numbers.

\section{Derivation of Standard Model Limits and Couplings}
To resolve criticisms regarding lack of predictive power:

\begin{itemize}
  \item In the low-energy limit \( \psi \rightarrow 0 \), \( \Gamma^A \rightarrow \gamma^\mu \), we recover the Dirac equation:
  \[ i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - m \psi = 0. \]
  \item The scalar potential \( V \) is expanded around vacuum expectation values to yield Yukawa couplings, giving rise to mass terms for leptons and quarks.
  \item Gauge couplings \( g_1, g_2, g_3 \) emerge from the curvature of \( \mathbb{C}^5 \) via background field configurations.
  \item Mixing angles and symmetry breaking patterns (Higgs mechanism analogs) can be encoded in \( V(\Theta) \).
\end{itemize}

\section{Fokker--Planck Equation and Conscious Drift}
We introduce a complex drift field \( D^A(q) \) and a probability density \( \rho(q,\tau) = \bar{\Theta} \Theta \). The dynamics follow:
\[ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \tau} = -\partial_A ( D^A \rho ) + \frac{1}{2} \partial_A \partial_B (D^{AB} \rho), \]
where \( \tau \in \mathbb{C} \) is complex time.

Drift is related to conscious selection of trajectory branches, and Metatime Action State (MAS) is defined as:
\[ \mathcal{M} = \int d^5q\, \psi(q) \bar{\Theta}(q) \Theta(q). \]

\section{Extended Derivations}

\subsection{Derivation of \( \hbar \), \( c \), and \( G \)}
We postulate that these constants emerge as geometric parameters in the moduli space of \( \mathbb{C}^5 \). The scaling of time and space-like coordinates defines \( c \), phase quantization under modular transformations fixes \( \hbar \), and the curvature of the spin connection contributes an effective Newtonian coupling \( G \) from the torsion sector.

\subsection{Lagrangian with Higgs Coupling}
Introducing a scalar doublet \( H \), the Higgs-Theta coupling reads:
\[
\mathcal{L}_\text{Yukawa} = y_f \bar{\Theta}_L H \Theta_R + h.c.
\]
Spontaneous symmetry breaking gives mass to fermions and gauge bosons, consistent with low-energy SM.

\subsection{Mass Matrix Construction}
Let \( \Theta \) have distinct internal components labeled by flavor and generation. Mass matrices \( M_f \) are derived from effective vevs:
\[
M_f = y_f \langle H \rangle.
\]

\subsection{Derivation of Dirac and Schrödinger Equations}
In flat background and phase-independent configuration, the Dirac equation follows:
\[
i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi = m \psi.
\]
Taking the non-relativistic limit yields Schrödinger's equation:
\[
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi.
\]

\section{Conclusion}
This work expands the Unified Biquaternion Theory by grounding it in derivable mathematics, showing connections to the Standard Model, proposing derivations for fundamental constants, and refining the role of \( \Theta \) in the emergence of physical and conscious structures.
