# Priority P5 â€“ Dark Matter from Topological Field Structures

This priority track proposes a novel explanation of dark matter within the **Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT)**. Instead of introducing new fundamental particles, we explore the possibility that **topologically nontrivial configurations** of the unified field \( \Theta(q, \tau) \) could account for the gravitational effects attributed to dark matter.

## Motivation

The lack of direct detection of traditional dark matter candidates such as WIMPs motivates alternative approaches. UBT naturally supports **topological solutions with zero electromagnetic charge** but nonzero stress-energy. These "dark modes" could represent invisible mass-energy distributions observable only via gravity.

## Research Proposal

See [`dark_matter_research_proposal.tex`](dark_matter_research_proposal.tex) for details, including:

- Construction of stable neutral solutions \( \Theta_D \),
- Classification by topological invariants,
- Simulations and comparison with observed galactic and cosmological data.

## Goal

Demonstrate that UBT inherently explains dark matter as a **topological and geometric phenomenon** within its unified field framework.
