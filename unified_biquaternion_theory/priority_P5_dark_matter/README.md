# Priority P5: Dark Matter – Research Motivation

This directory contains the theoretical motivation and initial proposal for exploring dark matter within the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT). We aim to explain the gravitational effects attributed to dark matter through topological and geometric configurations of the fundamental field Θ(q, τ).

## Content
- `dark_matter_research_proposal.tex`: Outlines the rationale, objectives, and theoretical background for dark matter research under UBT.
