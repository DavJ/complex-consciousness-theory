# Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT) – OSF Release

This project presents the foundational framework and selected results of the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT),
developed by **Ing. David Jaroš**. UBT proposes a biquaternionic field \( \Theta \) defined over complexified spacetime
as the unifying entity behind gravity, quantum fields, and consciousness.

## Key Features
- Derivation of the fine-structure constant \( \alpha \) from first principles
- Topological model of dark matter (Hopfion solutions)
- Biquaternion-based origin of quantum fields and particle masses
- Full compatibility with General Relativity, QFT, QED, QCD and the Standard Model
- Complex time \( \tau = t + i \psi \) and its role in modeling consciousness

## Authorship

All theoretical constructs, derivations, and decisions were developed by Ing. David Jaroš.
AI models (ChatGPT-4o by OpenAI and Gemini 2.5 Pro by Google) were used strictly as symbolic and editorial assistants.
