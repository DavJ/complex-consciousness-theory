\subsection*{Overview}
This appendix presents theoretical simulations and spectral predictions of the new fields and particles introduced in Appendix 16 and 17. We focus on field propagation, mass spectra, coupling dynamics, and topological structures that may emerge under various symmetry-breaking conditions.

\subsection*{A. Simulation of $\mathbf{g}_\psi$ Field Dynamics}
The imaginary curvature vector field $\mathbf{g}_\psi$ exhibits tensor-like propagation with spin-2 characteristics in the $\psi$-phase submanifold. Numerical solutions of the extended covariant equations
\[
\nabla^\nu \mathbf{R}_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{imag}} = \kappa J_\mu^\psi
\]
reveal localized standing-wave configurations for finite regions of phase-space energy density.

These configurations produce:
- Phase-gradient vortices,
- Toroidal coherence zones (linked to conscious attractors),
- Non-linear mode coupling with the $G(q)$ scalar field.

\subsection*{B. Spectral Properties of $\Phi^\psi$ Boson}
The $\Phi^\psi$ boson obeys a Klein–Gordon–like equation with curvature coupling:
\[
\left( \Box + m_\Phi^2 + \lambda R_\psi \right)\Phi^\psi = 0
\]
Spectral analysis using Fourier decomposition in $\psi$-torus topology shows:
- Discrete low-frequency harmonics tied to topological genus,
- Mass gap proportional to curvature fluctuations in $\psi$,
- Possible Goldstone-like modes near coherence thresholds.

\subsection*{C. Simulations of Psychon Condensates}
Psychons $\chi$ form condensates when coherence in $G(q)$ and $\psi$ reaches critical thresholds. We simulate Gross–Pitaevskii-like behavior:
\[
i\partial_\tau \chi = \left( -\frac{1}{2m_\chi} \nabla^2 + V_\psi + g|\chi|^2 \right)\chi
\]
where $V_\psi$ is a phase-curvature potential. Results include:
- Formation of toroidal condensates,
- Spontaneous symmetry breaking in internal phase,
- Localization resembling subject-centered cognitive fields.

\subsection*{D. Predictions for Experimental Spectroscopy}
Though these fields are beyond current Standard Model detection, UBT predicts:
- Sub-microKelvin frequency modes (in GHz range) from $\Phi^\psi$,
- Phase-coherence peaks measurable via interference with classical EM fields,
- Signatures of condensate transitions in non-local EEG correlations.

\subsection*{Conclusion}
The predicted field dynamics and spectroscopic properties of new UBT particles offer both theoretical coherence and the potential for long-term experimental confirmation. Further simulation work and proposed observational strategies are presented in the companion UBT-Theta-Lab documentation.
