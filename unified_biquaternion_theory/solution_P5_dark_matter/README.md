# Solution P5: Geometric and Topological Origin of Dark Matter

This directory presents the proposed solution to the dark matter problem based on the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT). We model dark matter as topologically stable, electromagnetically neutral configurations of the field Θ(q, τ).

## Content
- dark_matter.tex: Provides a detailed derivation of dark matter as dark modes within the UBT framework, including comparison with astrophysical observations.

- ThetaM_MassHierarchy.tex: This document proposes a mechanism for the mass hierarchy of leptons based on topological excitation modes of the Θ field.
Fitting equations and numerical comparisons are included.
