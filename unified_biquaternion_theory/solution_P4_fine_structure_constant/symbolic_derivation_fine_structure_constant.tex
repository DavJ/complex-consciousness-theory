\section*{Symbolic Derivation of the Fine-Structure Constant}

We hypothesize that the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ arises from the ratio of two fundamental frequencies:
\[
\alpha \approx \frac{\omega_q}{\omega_\Theta}
\]
Where $\omega_q$ is the coupling frequency of the electron field with the electromagnetic field and $\omega_\Theta$ is the intrinsic oscillation frequency of the underlying $\Theta$ field.

This derivation will aim to connect $\alpha$ with expressions derived from the Lagrangian of the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT), using:
\[
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c}
\]

Future steps include extracting $e$ from the interaction terms in the UBT Lagrangian.
