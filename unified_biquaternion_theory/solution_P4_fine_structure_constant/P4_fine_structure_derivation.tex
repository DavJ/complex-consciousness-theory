\section*{P4: Derivation of the Fine-Structure Constant}

In the context of the Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT), we explore how the fine-structure constant
\[
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c}
\]
emerges naturally from the structure of the field $\Theta(q, \tau)$.

In natural units (where $\varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi}$), this simplifies to:
\[
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{\hbar c}
\]

Our theory predicts the relative scale of $e$, $\hbar$, and $c$ through the internal coupling modes of $\Theta$,
which encodes charge, angular momentum, and phase velocity respectively.

This document includes symbolic derivation and a Python notebook for numeric verification.
