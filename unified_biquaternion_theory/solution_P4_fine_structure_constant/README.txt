This folder contains:
1. A symbolic derivation sketch of the fine-structure constant based on Unified Biquaternion Theory (UBT).
2. A Python script that calculates the known experimental value of alpha from constants.
3. Further steps are needed to compute theoretical frequency values from the UBT Lagrangian.
