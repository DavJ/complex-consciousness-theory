\section*{Scalar Constraint Equation in Biquaternionic Field}

Starting from the decomposition of the field:
\[
\Theta(q) = \rho(q) e^{i\phi(q)}
\]

We derived the constraint:
\[
\eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \rho \, \partial_\nu \phi = 0
\]

This implies orthogonality between gradients of amplitude and phase in Minkowski space.

\subsection*{Example: Spherical Symmetry}

Let:
\[
\rho = \rho(r), \quad \phi = \phi(t)
\]
Then:
\[
\partial_\mu \rho \, \partial^\mu \phi = \left(\frac{d\rho}{dr}\right)^2 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot \left(\frac{d\phi}{dt}\right)^2 = 0
\]

So the constraint is trivially satisfied.
