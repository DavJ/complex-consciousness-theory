\section*{Non-Trivial Solutions: Plane Wave Ansatz}

Let:
\[
\rho = \rho(\xi), \quad \phi = \phi(\xi), \quad \text{with } \xi = t - x
\]

Then:
\[
\partial_\mu \rho = \rho'(\xi) \partial_\mu \xi = \rho'(\xi)(1, -1, 0, 0)
\]
\[
\partial_\nu \phi = \phi'(\xi)(1, -1, 0, 0)
\]
\[
\eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \rho \, \partial_\nu \phi = \rho'(\xi) \phi'(\xi) \cdot (1^2 - (-1)^2) = 0
\]

So the constraint is satisfied for arbitrary functions of \( \xi = t - x \).
