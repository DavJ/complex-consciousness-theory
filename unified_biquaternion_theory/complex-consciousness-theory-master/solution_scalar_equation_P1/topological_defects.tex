\section*{Topological Phase Defects in Scalar Field \(\Theta\)}

Consider a vortex configuration in 2D:
\[
\phi(\theta) = n\theta, \quad \rho(r) \to 0 \text{ as } r \to 0
\]

Then:
\[
\nabla \phi = \frac{n}{r} \hat{\theta}, \quad \nabla \rho \sim \rho'(r) \hat{r}
\]

Their scalar product is zero due to orthogonality:
\[
\nabla \rho \cdot \nabla \phi = 0
\]

So the constraint is preserved even with a topological defect at the origin.
