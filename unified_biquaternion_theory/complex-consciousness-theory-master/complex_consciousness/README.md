ðŸ“„ **A Complex-Time Theory of Consciousness: Drift, Diffusion, and Phase Collapse in Toroidal Cognitive Space**

This paper introduces a novel mathematical framework for modeling consciousness using complex time and toroidal topology. We explore links to the Fokkerâ€“Planck equation, theta functions, time-frequency duality, and relativistic collapse of perceptual states.

Key concepts:
- Complexified time and space \((T = t + i\psi, Z = x + i\chi)\)
- Theta function-based probability distributions
- Conscious drift and diffusion on a torus
- Collapse of the toroidal phase space at \(v \to c\)
- Philosophical and physical implications for subjective experience

The project is theoretical and open to future extensions, simulations, and AI applications.
